In this repository I created an application that generates a random password according to the criteria determined by the end user. When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they are given a series of prompts. Depending on the input given by the user, the length and character types of the password are determined and validated. After this, the password is randomly generated using the JavaScript Math object, and the result is displayed on the page.
